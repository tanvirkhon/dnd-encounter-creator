# Dungeons and Dragons Encounter Creator 

## Description

## Created by : Korey Hermann, Tanvir Khondakar, Martin Cuellar

A Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) 5th Edition encounter builder for Dungeon Masters (DMs). The application allows DMs to create and track combat encounters for their DnD campaigns, giving them the ability to add monsters for their players to fight using a DnD 5e API linked to a database for monster stat sheets, while being able to track player character and enemy stats such as health and armour class. The application also allows the user to create an encounter for future use, and has a link to an external Spotify API to add background music to the fight.

The design concept for the site was created using figma:

With that Design we set out to create a fun and interactive site for all D&D fans to be able to come to and quickly create an encounter to play with their friends on game day. 

The encounter creator works in the following way:

## 1. Write out your encounter in the text box

## 2. Pick monsters you want to add to your encounter using the dropdown selector

Once you have picked your monster you will be able to see their basic stats and be able to delete them if you don't want them:

When you are ready to go if you click on the create your encounter button you encounter will be displayed in the my ecounters section:

## 3. Lastly what Encounter doesn't need music to set the mood. We have you coverd with a selection for DnD themed music from Spotify. Simply pick one that works for your encounter. Or if none match the mood for your encounter feel free to head to Spotify and find your own.

We hope you love this encounter creator and we can't wait to see what encounters you build with it.
